# CNN Image Classification with Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification, optimized using **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**. The main dataset used is **MNIST (digits 0â€“9)**, but the architecture is flexible and can be adapted to other image classification datasets. NAS is employed to automatically find the best network architecture, including the number of convolutional layers, filters, kernel sizes, and activation functions.
